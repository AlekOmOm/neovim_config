# Security Enhancements for Neovim Configuration

This PR adds comprehensive security features to protect sensitive information and enhance overall security in the Neovim configuration.

## Key Features Added

1. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Added `.env` file support to store sensitive settings
   - Created utility functions to load and access environment variables
   - Added `.env.example` template with comprehensive documentation

2. **Secure File Operations**
   - Implemented allowed directory validation
   - Added checks for potentially sensitive information in files
   - Created safe file reading/writing functions with confirmation dialogs

3. **Safe Command Execution**
   - Added allowed command validation
   - Implemented secure execution wrapper with configurable safeguards
   - Added environment variable override for allowed commands

4. **Personal Information Protection**
   - Added functions to redact personal information from logs
   - Protected hostnames, usernames, and file paths from exposure
   - Implemented sanitization of debug output

5. **Updated Machine-Specific Configuration**
   - Modified machine configs to use environment variables
   - Removed hardcoded paths and hostnames
   - Added fallbacks for when environment variables aren't set

## Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with security feature documentation
- Added detailed SECURITY.md explaining all security features
- Updated .gitignore to exclude .env files and other sensitive files
- Added comprehensive comments in code

## Implementation Details

- **Early Loading**: Security features are loaded early in startup sequence
- **Optional Confirmations**: Can be disabled for trusted environments
- **Extensible**: Easy to add additional security patterns or allowed directories
- **Cross-Platform**: Works correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## How To Test

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize for your environment
2. Try accessing files outside allowed directories to test confirmations
3. Execute commands not in the allowed list to test command validation
4. Check logs for properly redacted personal information

## Future Improvements

- Add more granular control over specific file paths
- Implement additional checks for other types of sensitive information
- Consider automated security testing for the configuration
