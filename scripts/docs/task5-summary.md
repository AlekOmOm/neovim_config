# Summary of Task #5: Audit External Dependencies

**Overall Goal:** To audit and manage external dependencies required by the Neovim configuration, ensuring users are informed about necessary tools and that configurations are robust.

## Subtasks Undertaken:

1.  **Subtask 5.1: Create Plugin Dependency Inventory (Status: done)**
    *   Reviewed all plugin configurations (`lua/plugins/init.lua`, `lua/plugins/lsp/`, etc.).
    *   Compiled a comprehensive list of external dependencies including core system tools (git, node, npm, python, C compilers, make) and those required by LSPs and specific plugins.
    *   Documented required tools, versions (where applicable), and installation methods.

2.  **Subtask 5.2: Implement Dependency Checker Function (Status: done)**
    *   Created a new Lua module: `lua/utils/dependency_checker.lua`.
    *   Implemented functions to check for the presence and versions of executables listed in the inventory.
    *   The checker handles multiple possible executable names (e.g., `python3`/`python`, `gcc`/`clang`/`cc`) and is cross-platform aware for error redirection.
    *   Includes a structured `dependency_inventory` table.
    *   A main function `verify_all_dependencies()` orchestrates checks, including underlying dependencies for LSPs.

3.  **Subtask 5.3: Create Dependency Notification System (Status: done)**
    *   Created a new Lua module: `lua/utils/dependency_notifier.lua`.
    *   Implemented `notify_dependency_issues()` which uses the checker module.
    *   Formats results into user-friendly messages using `vim.notify`.
    *   Uses different notification levels (ERROR for missing, WARN for version low/check error, INFO for general information or OK status).

4.  **Subtask 5.4: Verify and Fix Plugin Configurations (Status: done)**
    *   Reviewed configurations for `markdown-preview.nvim`, LSP servers (Mason/lspconfig), and plugins with build steps (`telescope-fzf-native`, `nvim-treesitter`).
    *   Confirmed that existing `run` commands and path handlings are generally correct.
    *   The primary enhancement for "fixing" configurations in terms of external dependencies was the implementation of the proactive checker and notifier system.

5.  **Subtask 5.5: Create Dependency Documentation (Status: done)**
    *   Created a comprehensive `DEPENDENCIES.md` file detailing all identified external dependencies, installation instructions for various platforms, version requirements, and troubleshooting tips.
    *   Updated the main `README.md` with a new "External Dependencies" section, linking to `DEPENDENCIES.md` and explaining the automatic dependency checking feature.

## Key Files Modified/Created:

*   `lua/utils/dependency_checker.lua` (New)
*   `lua/utils/dependency_notifier.lua` (New)
*   `DEPENDENCIES.md` (New)
*   `README.md` (Modified to include a section on external dependencies)
*   `scripts/docs/task5-summary.md` (This summary document)

## Important Pending User Actions:

*   **Integrate Notifier:** Add a call to `require('utils.dependency_notifier').notify_dependency_issues()` in an appropriate place in the Neovim startup sequence (e.g., in `init.lua` or `lua/plugins/setup.lua` after plugins are likely loaded and `nvim-notify` is available).
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Test the dependency checker and notifier by:
    *   Temporarily uninstalling a known required tool (e.g., `node` or `make`).
    *   Temporarily downgrading a tool to a version below a specified minimum (if feasible).
    *   Ensuring notifications appear as expected and provide clear guidance.
    *   Verifying that the "all clear" notification appears when all dependencies are met.

This concludes the work on Task #5.
