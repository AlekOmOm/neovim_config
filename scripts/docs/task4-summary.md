# Summary of Task #4: Optimize Plugin Loading Performance

**Overall Goal:** To identify and optimize slow-loading Neovim plugins and implement lazy-loading and other strategies to improve startup time.

## Subtasks Undertaken:

1.  **Subtask 4.1: Implement Profiling Mechanism (Status: done)**
    *   A Lua script (`lua/utils/analyze_profile.lua`) was created to parse Neovim's startup profile logs (`profile.log`) and identify slow-loading plugins and functions.
    *   Instructions for enabling profiling in `init.lua` were established.

2.  **Subtask 4.2: Analyze Plugin Loading Performance (Status: done)**
    *   Profiling was conducted, and the results were analyzed.
    *   Key plugins contributing to startup time were identified.
    *   The findings were documented in `task4_plugin_optimization_status.txt`, which guided subsequent optimization efforts.

3.  **Subtask 4.3: Implement Lazy-Loading Configuration (Status: done)**
    *   Based on the analysis, lazy-loading was implemented in `lua/plugins/init.lua` for the following plugins:
        *   `nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter`: Loaded on `BufReadPost` and `BufNewFile` events.
        *   `hrsh7th/nvim-cmp` (and dependencies): Loaded on `InsertEnter` event.
        *   `ThePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim`: Loaded on the `Refactor` command.
        *   `tpope/vim-fugitive`: Loaded on Git-related commands (`Git`, `G`, `Gstatus`, `Gblame`).
        *   `smjonas/inc-rename.nvim`: Loaded on the `IncRename` command.
    *   *Testing of these changes is pending GitHub accessibility for `:PackerSync`.*

4.  **Subtask 4.4: Integrate Module Caching with impatient.nvim (Status: done)**
    *   The plugin `lewis6991/impatient.nvim` was added to `lua/plugins/init.lua` to cache Lua modules and potentially speed up loading.
    *   `require('impatient')` was added early in the `init.lua` sequence.
    *   *Installation and testing via `:PackerSync` are pending GitHub accessibility.*

5.  **Subtask 4.5: Optimize Plugin Load Order (Status: done)**
    *   The plugin load order in `lua/plugins/init.lua` was reviewed.
    *   It was concluded that the existing order, combined with the newly implemented `impatient.nvim` and extensive lazy-loading, is sufficiently optimized. No changes were made.

## Key Files Modified/Created:

*   `lua/plugins/init.lua`: Updated with lazy-loading configurations and `impatient.nvim`.
*   `lua/utils/analyze_profile.lua`: New script for parsing profile logs.
*   `scripts/docs/task4_plugin_optimization_status.txt`: Notes and status tracking for the task (created by the user, updated by AI).
*   `scripts/docs/task4-summary.md`: This summary document.

## Important Pending User Actions:

*   **Once GitHub services are restored:**
    1.  Run `:PackerSync` in Neovim (or restart Neovim twice) to install new plugins (`impatient.nvim`) and apply all configuration changes.
    2.  Thoroughly test the functionality of all lazy-loaded plugins to ensure they activate correctly under their specified triggers.
    3.  Verify the general stability and behavior of Neovim with `impatient.nvim` active.
    4.  (Optional but Recommended) Re-run the profiling script (`lua/utils/analyze_profile.lua`) to measure and quantify the startup time improvements resulting from these optimizations.

This concludes the work on Task #4.
